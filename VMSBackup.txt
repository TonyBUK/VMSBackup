Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This application stemmed from my inability to verify archives of VAX Media in a PC
environment for legacy programs I'm responsible for.  Previously, I'd either need to get
listings, or visit the server admin to get him to mount the VAX Media on the network.

For those who don't know VAX Backup Sets are essentially equivalent to .TAR archives in
UNIX, except they also store all the Open VMS O/S data, such as record formats (whereas on
most operating systems, a text file would be delimited by LR/CR or CR conventions,
typically in Open VMS, they would be stored as variable length records, meaning if you
don't properly handle them, you'll typically end up with a file where everything is on a
single line).

Granted the implementation is severe overkill, however, for me it's actually
become a very very useful utility.  It evolved from a simple parsing application derived
from me staring at the backup data sets with a hex editor trying to determine the rules
into a more considered/researched application capable of extracting data from backup sets.

The main feature I find useful is the "Smart" extraction.  This feature is quite simple,
any extracted files are considered ASCII unless any contents within the file are found to
be in the extended ASCII range (> 0x7F).  Obviously there's always exceptions to the rule,
but it works pretty well in my testing, and the tool does allow itself to be forced into
the appropriate mode.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
O/S Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When building from source, there's no reason that it shouldn't support other O/S.  I have
built and run it from Solaris and OS X Snow Leopard.  I've also heard of successful results
on pre-Intel versions of OSX.

To port, you'll need to modify 1 file (possibly more if it's on a system I've not yet
ported to).

alignment.h
For an x86 processor (i.e., Windows, OS X Snow Leopard etc) leave as is.
For non-x86 processors, consult the endian rules etc.  On the solaris box I used, I needed
to use the 2nd set (i.e., reverse ordered the bytes).

For convenience, the VMS Executable self-checks it's alignment on startup, and reports an
error if there's a mismatch.

For type sizes, this defers compatability to stdint.h.  If this is not available (i.e.,
Visual Studio), grab a copy from http://code.google.com/p/msinttypes/downloads/list

For Solaris 9, use inttypes.h instead (my kludge was just to copy this locally as
stdint.h).

I appreciate this isn't as easy as before, but providing you have an up-to-date compiler,
it should be relatively painless to find an implementation.

For convenience, the VMS Executable self-checks it's types on startup, and reports an
error if there's a mismatch.

Note : By default, alignment is setup for X86.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Various list formats.
- Supress
- Brief (mimicks the first 2 lines of : backup /list /save_set /full
- Full (mimicks all of backup /list /save_set / full)
- CSV (all data in full output as a CSV file)

File Extraction.
- File and Version Masking (including limited relative version support (;0, ;-1 etc)
- 4 Modes, Smart, ASCII, Binary, Raw.
- Smart switches ASCII/Binary per file having analysed the contents.
- ASCII handles end of line protocols (CR/LF).
- Binary outputs the raw (except records) files.
- Raw outputs the raw binary data, including the record length fields.
- Extract with version numbers in-tact/suppressed
- Extract with path names in-tact (Note : Currently, the path is actually just put in the
  file name as it's not hugely useful for me at present, and I didn't really want to faff
  about with too much of the O/S API's, but this behaviour will almost certainly change in
  future versions).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1/  Plug in any gaps in terms of the data handling.  I'm certain that certain assumptions in
    the app may only hold true for backup sets I've created.

2/  Hookup handling of other record types.

3/  More robust error handling.

4/  CRC validation of contents.

5/  Expand debug mode to provide more useful info on crashes.

6/  Possibly make smart mode remember binary extentions?  i.e., if most .bin files have
    binary data, treat all .bin files as binary...

7/  Modify the interface to be more consistant with the VMS backup tool itself for ease of
    migration.

8/  Better list output handling

9/  Maybe allow other mechanisms for converting records.  Currently I feel that CR/LF and
    Raw mode between them handle this quite well (CR/LF give you delimeters, whereas as Raw
    gives the end user the ability to manually convert them).  Possibly some sort of plug-in
    based mechanism?

10/ Possibly improve the wild card handling to exclude paths from the pattern match?

11/ Handle other aspects of the block, such as the Block Summary etc.

12/ GUI Interface (or at least plug into some other generic archive GUI interface)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What isn't planned.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating backup sets from the PC.  I can't really fathom how this would be in anyway useful
since the whole point of the backup sets is that it allows me to store data that would
otherwise be lost when archiving onto a PC.  (Such as record structures etc)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compilation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This code should be relatively portable.  It relies heavily upon the use of stdint.h.  If
this isn't natively provided by your compiler, search for it in google.  Doing this has
allowed me to compile in:

Visual Studio
// ISO C9x  compliant stdint.h for Microsoft Visual Studio

Solaris
 * This file, <inttypes.h>, is tracking the ISO/JTC1/SC22/WG14 C committee's
 * working draft for the revision of the current ISO C standard, ISO/IEC
 * 9899:1990 Programming language - C.

I've deliberately avoided struct overlays/alignment etc, so no special rules for compilation
should be required.

Something I managed to *completely* miss when developing the application.  Chances are this
tool will work for 99% of the people out there, and from what I've read, appears to have a
far stronger pedigree than my tool, especially how long the code base as a whole has been
around and how many backup sets it would have been used with (whilst mine has restored
tens of thousands of files, in reality this is only in the sub-fifty range of archives all
produced in a similar fashion).

This is a very nice function to handle permutations of wild cards (asterisk and ? marks).

Note : I've made a very slight mod to the header to extern "C" if being used from C++ code.

Very useful reference application written to perform the same task in UNIX from tape.  In
fact it's easy to question why I wrote mine at all given the existance of this.  The
reasoning is :
1/ I didn't know it existed when I started.
2/ By the time I did, I had certain functionality that went above/beyond, so using it as
   reference to clean up as many hard-coded assumptions as I could was the way to go.

Whilst there's no source available, and it doesn't handle some of the larger files I've
thrown at it, and it forces files to unique 8:3 combinations, this has been useful for
debugging save sets I've produced.

History
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.5 - Performed side-by-side testing with VMSBackup 4.4.3.
      1/ Raw VBN writes for records were missing the final byte of a file.
         This was due to records deliberately suppressing the final byte,
         which was implemented due to observations at the time.  However
         in reality, the core issue was already fixed, and the workaround
         was interfering with the little used raw write mode.
         This also allows me to remove needing to identify if this is a
         record or not.
      2/ Confirmed for all other scenarios I get comparable values, with
         the major difference being EOL conventions which I've hard coded
         to Windows standards.
      3/ I've taken some initial measures to potentially allow more
         flexibility in EOL detection / usage.  It's a possible change for
         down the line, albeit these days most decent editors will allow
         on the fly conversion anyway.
1.4 - Small command line tweak.  The extraction default is now set on as
      opposed to off, and -E has been replaced with -N, which disables
      extraction instead of enabling it.  This means for a typical use
      case, no parameters are required for the tool beyond the backup
      set.
1.3 - Added header dumping.
1.2 - Fixed the following issues:
      1/ The single-pass selection criteria was still broken.  A two pass
         mechanism is required if one of the following is in effect:
         a) Smart Extraction is enabled.
         b) Version selection is in effect.
      2/ Broke the mask handling for file extensions.
         for example -M:*.ADA;* didn't work, but *.ADA*;* did!
      3/ Enhanced the outputs for file format and file attributes based
         upon comparison to VAX directory data.  What isn't completely
         known is how much is hard coded, and how much is specific to the
         VAX setup I'm using.
      4/ Cleaned up invalid records at the EOF.  I've suppressed outputting
         errors on the last block unless debug or enhanced debug is
         selected.  Processing *will* still abort though.
      5/ Fixed an issue whereby the tool would seemingly randomly choose to
         place an EOL at the end of the file or ignore it.  This was the
         result of some overly complex rules regarding records that span
         blocks.  There's now a much simpler rule in place, if we're at the
         end of a record and an LRCF isn't detected (and this is a file
         requiring ASCII conversion), then an LRCF is added.
      6/ Left some placemarker code in the DumpFullFileHeader to allow
         alternating between a dir /full output and a backup view output.
         Ideally this sort of thing could be configurable i.e.
         -LB:[Options] for Backup View and -LD:[Options] for a Dir View
         which could support the whole plethora of VAX options... but I
         doubt I'll ever get to that.
      7/ Fixed a very nasty bug whereby a variable record header that spans
         a block wasn't correctly handled resulting in the file itself
         being incorrectly handled in either a binary or ascii mode.
1.1 - Fixed two issues:
      1/ Broke the single-pass mechanism for data output.
      2/ Fixed an issue with VBN Raw records whereby the file pointer wasn't
         being incremented for the last file chunk.
      There's still the invalid record at the EOF, but thus-far I've no clue
      about what that actually represents but the issue seems harmless enough
      for now.
1.0 - First version under configuration control.
0.4 - Removed the -A parameter in favour of improving wild card support to
      handle VAX versioning, including relative versions (0, -1 etc).
      So a mask of *.*;* is equivalent to -A, and a mask of *.*;0 is
      equivalent to unsetting the flag.  This should improve useability
      by some margin.  Now it's possible to get all versions of a file without
      having to set -V!
0.3 - Fixed issue in ProcessVBNVar whereby record entry headers that span
      Blocks resulted in the tool locking up.  These are now handled
      with no apparent issues.

      Fixed issue in ProcessVBNNonVar whereby the LR/CF detection fell over
      if LR/CF spanned two records.  Additionally improved detection logic
      designed to ungarble various mangled LR/CF combinations.

      Unified the majority of the file writing to use a new routine called
      VMSWriteFile.  This gives a single point of entry for handling ASCII
      data output.

      Improved EOL handling in ProcessVBNNonVar which will hopefully
      EOL's occuring if the record already ends with an EOL.  I'm hesitant
      to suppress them if any EOL's are present until I've further data.
      This should fix a certain mismatch between ASCII data transferred via
      FTP and data decoded from the BCK archive.

      Moved most of the code into the file Process.cpp.  This will
      eventually be further broken down, but for now, it helps to allow
      this file to focus on front-end matters.

      Removed basictypes.h in favour of using stdint.h.  In the event that
      this library isn't available (Visual Studio), you can grab a version
      of the library from:

      http://code.google.com/p/msinttypes/downloads/list

      However it's worth noting that I had to modify line 50 to:

      extern "C++" {

      in order to get it to compile with Visual Studio 6.  Also, be sure to
      add the following pre-processor definition __STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS.

      This last update increases portability, and hopefully removes the
      need for me to constantly re-jig types to increase compatability.
      Anyone know of something similar for type alignment?

0.2 - Fixed file pointer tracking in ProcessVBNNonVar to prevent garbage
      data being appended to a file.

      Modified ProcessVBNVar to handle VFC types (appear to be variable
      records with 8 bit checksum data).  UDF has been mapped to just
      output raw data.

      Made default behaviour of invalid data or non-VBN/Volume/NULL records
      to close any open file handles.

      Minor compiler fix for Solaris when testing size/alignment data.

      Now verified as correct on over 1 Gigs worth of backup sets
      (> 20,000 files).  Auto mode actually corrected some issues found
      when FTP'ing data which contained records and LR/CF data!

0.1 - Initial version.

Contact
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please feel free to contact me with any issues etc.  This is a spare time project, but I'd
certainly be interested to see if it handles other backup sets etc.  If you have any that
don't work, please remember that unless I have at least a sample of failing data, there's
not an awful lot I can do.

Source code patches are also fine, whilst I won't force you to, I'm always happy to receive
any enhancements / patches.  I'd also be interested to see if people can get this building
in a non-windows environment (I personally run Windows and OS X, but primarily develop in
Windows).
